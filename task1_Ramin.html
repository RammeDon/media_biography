                            and how even high achieving people can suffer from negative <br>

                            Mark Oliver Everett is known for writing songs on subjects <br>
                            such as death, loneliness, divorce, depression and other <br>
                            tragic subjects. This is my favorite song from him.

                            Back when I used to live in Iran I lived next to a mountain, <br>
                            and so I would hike up the mountain weekly with friends and <br>
                            it became a hobby of mine. This picture is one I took on a <br>
                            mountain in northern Iran, the place was called "3000" because <br>
                            it was 3000 meters above water level.

                            The Toyota AE86 is a 1980s sports car. One of my favorite <br>
                            cartoons has always been Initial D and in that cartoon this <br>
                            toyota is raced against other cars. Gradually after watching <br>
                            the show and bunch of YouTube videos later this became my <br>
                            dream car which I hope to buy one day.

                            I'd always do in my free times was watching old boxing <br>
                            matches to learn from them but then I slowly began to <br>
                            watch it as entertainment as well. This is a match between <br>
